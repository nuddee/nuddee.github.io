# Project-1 description
## Overview


>In this project, I am working on the "Car Market Analytics" web application using Vite React base and Chartjs to visualize the chart from provided JSON files. Moreover, I used the Bootstrap CSS framework and the Font Awesome library for styling my Car Market Analytics application. And using React Router to create a browser-based router function.
